## Notes
- use BLoC/Cubit architecture for this using the Flutter framework.
- Create a login flow  (Email and Password by just validating the fields using the validator in bloc/cubit)
- On dashboard shows a listing of employees using this API:- https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees
- Add searching by the employee name.
- Add a filter on the basis of employee age by initially grouping the age values. For e.g:- 20 years to 30 years, 31 years to 40 years, and so on, by the difference of 10 years and take the lower and upper bound from the API.
